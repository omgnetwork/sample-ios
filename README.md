# OmiseGO iOS sample

The OmiseGO iOS sample app is a simple example app not a “real-world” application.
It was only created to show how the [iOS SDK](https://github.com/omisego/ios-sdk) can be integrated by using all the available features.

It is a simple clothing shop where people can buy t-shirts and get loyalty points. Since it’s just a sample app, there is no checkout flow or actual payments.

The currency used is the Thai Baht (฿). The loyalty points received are OMGs (because we created that sample minted token on the demo eWallet, they are not actual OMG tokens and could be anything else defined on the server ;))
